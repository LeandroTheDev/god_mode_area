# God Mode Area
Creates a fully configurable area, players in that area will become god mode, if player exit will lose, configurable timer to lose after exiting area.

About configurations, i did not recomend using the vanilla god mode, because its little bugged, but if you want fell free, vanilla god mode have more performance too,
if you are using vanilla the tickrate in configuration is unecessary.

Bugs can cause and potencially break the server if the food or water player is different from ``100``

# Building

*Windows*: The project uses dotnet 4.8, consider installing into your machine, you need visual studio, simple open the solution file open the Build section and hit the build button (ctrl + shift + b) or you can do into powershell the command dotnet build -c Debug if you have installed dotnet 4.8.

*Linux*: Unfortunately versions lower than 6 of dotnet do not have support for linux, the best thing you can do is install dotnet 6 or the lowest possible version on your distro and try to compile in dotnet 6 using the command dotnet build -c Debug, this can cause problems within rocket loader.
